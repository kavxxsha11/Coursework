                <h2>Difference Between HTML & HTML5</h2>
                <p>Posted on <time datetime="2023-10-21">October 21, 2023</time></p>
                <p>Both HTML and HTML5 are markup languages, but HTML5 introduced a few 
                    improvements that expanded the possibilities of what could be done using 
                    standard HTML. Originally, HTML was designed primarily to define the structure 
                    and basic layout of web content. As the web evolved, HTML needed to support increasingly dynamic and interactive elements.</p>
                    <p>HTML5 is the latest specification, designed to offer a more powerful, 
                    flexible framework. HTML5 also brought in native support for offline storage, canvas graphics, and beefed-up form controls. All these 
                    have cemented HTML5 as a backbone in modern web development to achieve richer user experiences with simpler, more efficient code.</p>

                <h2>Difference Between Article & Aside elements in HTML5</h2>
                <p>Posted on <time datetime="2024-06-15">June 15, 2024</time></p>
                <p>The article element represents content that stands alone. 
                    Think of it as a complete, self-contained piece that has independent meaning. 
                    It could be a blog post, a news story, a product description, or really 
                    anything that makes sense on its own. You can take an article and put it in another 
                    page or context entirely on its own, and it will still make sense.</p>

                    <p>On the other hand, the aside element is for content that is somehow 
                    related to but not critical to the main content: information adding 
                    value or context, a sidebar of related links, a callout of author information, 
                    or a list of related articles. If aside is contained within an article, it provides 
                    content directly related to that article. When outside of an article, it will often 
                    be used as a sidebar for the entire page with general, supporting 
                    information like ads or links to other sections of the site.</p>

                <h2>Difference Between a linear gradient and a radial gradient</h2>
                <p>Posted on <time datetime="2024-03-03">March 03, 2024</time></p>
                <p>Linear gradient and radial gradient are two mechanisms to give smooth 
                    blending between colors in CSS but differs from each other in direction and geometry.</p>

                    <p>*Linear Gradient: A linear gradient work out the slope of color in a straight 
                    line can be either in a horizontal, vertical or diagonal. It allows you to specify 
                    direction of gradient (for example, up & down or left & right) and set several color stops on the top line.</p>
                    
                    <p>*Radial Gradient: Radial gradient, however, make colors transition from a 
                    center point, which often forms annular or oval shapes. As for the color it is 
                    more spread out or extended towards the edges coming from the middle part.</p>
