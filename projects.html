                <h2>Difference Between HTML & HTML5</h2>
                <p>Both HTML and HTML5 are markup languages, but HTML5 introduced a few 
                    improvements that expanded the possibilities of what could be done using 
                    standard HTML. Originally, HTML was designed primarily to define the structure 
                    and basic layout of web content. As the web evolved, HTML needed to support increasingly dynamic and interactive elements.
    
                    HTML5 is the latest specification, designed to offer a more powerful, 
                    flexible framework. HTML5 also brought in native support for offline storage, canvas graphics, and beefed-up form controls. All these 
                    have cemented HTML5 as a backbone in modern web development to achieve richer user experiences with simpler, more efficient code.</p>

                <h2>Difference Between Article & Aside elements in HTML5</h2>
                <p>The article element represents content that stands alone. 
                    Think of it as a complete, self-contained piece that has independent meaning. 
                    It could be a blog post, a news story, a product description, or really 
                    anything that makes sense on its own. You can take an article and put it in another 
                    page or context entirely on its own, and it will still make sense.

                    On the other hand, the aside element is for content that is somehow 
                    related to but not critical to the main content: information adding 
                    value or contextâ€”say, a sidebar of related links, a callout of author information, 
                    or a list of related articles. If aside is contained within an article, it provides 
                    content directly related to that article. When outside of an article, it will often 
                    be used as a sidebar for the entire page with general, supporting 
                    information like ads or links to other sections of the site.</p>

                    HTML5 is the latest specification, designed to offer a more powerful, 
                    flexible framework. It brought new semantic elements like '<header>', '<footer>', 
                    '<article>', and '<section>' for better content organization; interactive 
                    APIs handle the multimedia directly with the '<audio>' and '<video>' tags, dispensing with the need for plugins. 
                    HTML5 also brought in native support for offline storage, canvas graphics, and beefed-up form controls. All these
